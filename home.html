	<p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, 
and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment 
and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and
 renewed funding. For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that
 often fail to communicate with each other. These sub-fields are based on technical
 considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"),
 the use of particular tools ("logic" or "neural networks"), or deep philosophical 
 differences. Subfields have also been based on social factors (particular
 institutions or the work of particular researchers). </p>
